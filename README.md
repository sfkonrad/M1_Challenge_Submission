# M1_Challenge_Submission
KKozicki's UCBx FinTech 'Module_1_Challenge' Submission repository

Welcome to our first Course Challenge. Each module concludes with a graded Challenge assignment, where we'll apply your new skills to a fintech problem. Challenges are designed to be complex, and typically take several hours to complete. The Challenge rubric, included in the Requirements section, contains more information about how this assignment is graded.

### **Background**
We're working for a lending startup engaged in microcredit loans. The company needs help valuing these loans. In this Project, we've automated a process that does just that.

### **What We've Created**
We created a simple Python program that automates the tasks associated with valuing microlending loans. Specifically, we've done the following:

1. Create a GitHub Repository

2. Automate the Calculations

3. Analyze Loan Data

4. Perform Financial Calculations

5. Conditionally Filter Lists of Loans

6. Save the Results

We then ratified the poject by proceeding to upload the final code to GitHub.
