"""Part 3: Perform Financial Calculations.

Perform financial calculations using functions.

1. Define a new function that will be used to calculate present value.
    a. This function should include parameters for `future_value`, `remaining_months`, and the `annual_discount_rate`
    b. The function should return the `present_value` for the loan.
2. Use the function to calculate the present value of the new loan given below.
    a. Use an `annual_discount_rate` of 0.2 for this new loan calculation.
